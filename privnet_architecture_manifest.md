# PrivNet Architecture Manifest

## Vision
PrivNet exists to restore privacy, autonomy, and speed to online communication.  
The network is built on a hybrid model that uses both peer-to-peer connections and transparent relay servers.  
Every component serves a single purpose: give users control over their identity and their data without sacrificing performance.

---

## 1. Identity Layer — Decentralized Keys
- Each user generates their own cryptographic key pair.  
- No central login, no passwords, no accounts that can be “deleted.”  
- Optional readable aliases map to keys through public registries.

*Outcome:* No central authority owns identity.

---

## 2. Data Layer — Personal Vaults
- User data lives in encrypted personal vaults, local or remote.  
- Servers only relay ciphertext; they can never see the content.  
- Data replication occurs between trusted peers using end-to-end encryption.

*Outcome:* Ownership stays with the creator.

---

## 3. Relay Layer — Federated Servers
- Lightweight servers exist only to accelerate routing and peer discovery.  
- Each server publishes open audit logs to verify compliance.  
- Anyone can host a relay node under the same open charter.

*Outcome:* Speed without surveillance.

---

## 4. Communication Layer — Peer Network
- Peers connect through a distributed hash table (DHT) for discovery.  
- When a user is offline, encrypted messages are temporarily held by relays.  
- No metadata logging, no analytics collection.

*Outcome:* Real-time private communication.

---

## 5. Governance — Transparent Protocol Council
- Open protocol improvements, signed votes, public changelogs.  
- Node reputation built on uptime and validation accuracy, not wealth or influence.  
- Protocol designed to evolve through community consensus.

*Outcome:* Accountability without hierarchy.

---

## Implementation Path (2025–2026)
1. Prototype key generation and encrypted vault model.  
2. Build lightweight relay demo for peer discovery.  
3. Release draft of privacy audit charter.  
4. Expand open participation and feedback loop.
