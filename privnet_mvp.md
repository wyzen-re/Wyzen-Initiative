# PrivNet MVP (Concept Sketch)

## Vision
PrivNet will be the next-generation private network that restores privacy, control, and freedom online.

## Core Features (Draft)
- *End-to-end encrypted social layer*: users own their identity and interactions.
- *Peer-to-peer infrastructure*: no centralized servers to track or censor.
- *Decentralized data vaults*: users host their own info in encrypted containers.
- *Open-access API*: for developers to build tools that respect privacy by design.

## Stage 1 (2025â€“2026)
- Design prototype architecture using open-source frameworks.
- Simulate user data exchange using dummy datasets.
- Publish research brief by end of 2026.
