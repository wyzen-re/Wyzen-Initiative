# PrivNet MVP — Concept Sketch

PrivNet is about *privacy, control, and freedom* online. Here’s the plan so far.

## Core Features

- *Encrypted Messaging:* Messages only the recipient can read.  
- *Encrypted File Sharing:* Send files without servers ever seeing them.  
- *Peer-to-Peer Connections:* Data goes directly between users whenever possible.  
- *Optional Relay Servers:* Speed things up without compromising privacy.  
- *User Vaults:* Your files are encrypted and stored under your control.

## Example Flow

1. Alice wants to send a photo to Bob.  
2. Alice encrypts the photo in her vault.  
3. PrivNet sends it directly to Bob (or through a relay if needed).  
4. Bob decrypts it with his key.  
5. No one else sees it.

## Stage 1 (2025–2026)

- Prototype key generation and encrypted vaults.  
- Test peer-to-peer messaging.  
- Gather feedback from early users.
