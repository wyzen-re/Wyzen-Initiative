# Wyzen Initiative 🚀

"The network bows to none."

PrivNet is my project to give people *control over their own data*. You own it, you control it, and you can share safely — no corporations or governments spying.

---

## Why You Should Care

- Messages and files *stay private*, even if they go through servers.  
- You decide *who sees your data* — no random people or companies.  
- Network still works fast using optional servers, but *they can’t read your stuff*.

Example: You send a photo to a friend — only they can see it. Nobody else, ever.

## Vision

Most apps and websites track, sell, or manipulate your data. PrivNet is a network *built for the user, not corporations*.  

- *Ownership:* You control your data.  
- *Privacy:* End-to-end encryption keeps it safe.  
- *Freedom:* The network is censorship-resistant and open.
