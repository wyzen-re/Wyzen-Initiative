# Wyzen-Initiative
Building the framework for digital privacy, autonomy, and cyber integrity for the modern era.

  
The Wyzen Initiative is a vision to redefine privacy, security, and digital ethics in a connected world.  
We aim to build the foundation for a future where individuals control their data, and technology serves humanity—not the other way around.

Founded by Sheron “Wyzen” Gurusinghe, 2025.
