# Wyzen Initiative

*The network bows to none.*  

The Wyzen Initiative is building *PrivNet*: a hybrid network where users own their data, control their identity, and communicate freely — without surveillance, manipulation, or centralized control.  

PrivNet combines the speed and reliability of selective relay servers with the privacy and sovereignty of peer-to-peer connections. Every message, every file, every interaction is encrypted and controlled by its creator.

## Vision

We live in a world where data is exploited, privacy is eroded, and digital freedom is optional. PrivNet is a statement: the network belongs to the user, not corporations or governments. By building hybrid, decentralized infrastructure, we ensure:

- *Ownership:* All data belongs to the user by default.  
- *Privacy:* End-to-end encryption for all communications and storage.  
- *Freedom:* A censorship-resistant, transparent network for anyone to join.

## Architecture (Draft)

- *Identity Layer:* Decentralized cryptographic keys define your digital identity.  
- *Data Layer:* Personal vaults store encrypted data; relay servers never see content.  
- *Relay Layer:* Federated servers accelerate routing without compromising privacy.  
- *Communication Layer:* Peer-to-peer connections handle messaging and file exchange.  
- *Governance:* Open protocol council, community-driven upgrades, transparent logs.
