# Policy Brief v0 — The Right to Digital Autonomy

## Problem

Governments and companies track, collect, and exploit our data. Users have no real control or transparency.

## Goal

- People should *own and control their own data*.  
- Surveillance should require *justification and public accountability*.  
- Policies should *empower individuals*, not institutions.

## Draft Framework

1. *Data Ownership Clause* — Anything you create belongs to you.  
2. *Consent Ledger* — Every data use is logged for you to see.  
3. *Digital Sovereignty Index (DSI)* — Ranks governments and companies on how well they respect digital rights.
