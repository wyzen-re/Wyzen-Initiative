# Policy Brief v0 — The Right to Digital Autonomy

## Problem
Governments and corporations have weaponized surveillance under the guise of “security.”  
Users have no true ownership of their data, no transparency on how it’s used, and no universal right to privacy.

## Goal
To propose a foundational model of digital autonomy:  
- Every citizen has the right to know, control, and erase their personal data.  
- Governments must adhere to “mutual transparency,” where surveillance requires proportional justification and public accountability.  
- Cyber policies should empower individuals, not institutions.

## Proposed Framework (draft)
1. *Data Ownership Clause* — All data created by an individual is owned by that individual by default.  
2. *Consent Ledger* — Every data transaction (storage, sharing, analysis) must be logged in a verifiable ledger visible to the data owner.  
3. *Digital Sovereignty Index (DSI)* — A rating system to measure governments’ and corporations’ respect for digital rights.
