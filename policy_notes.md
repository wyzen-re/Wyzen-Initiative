# Policy Notes

*Note 1 — GDPR’s Strengths and Weaknesses*
The GDPR introduced global awareness on digital rights, but enforcement is slow, and corporations exploit loopholes through vague consent models.  
Goal: Simplify user rights while ensuring enforcement is automated and real-time, not bureaucratic.

*Note 2 — Data Colonialism*
The modern economy thrives on extracting user data without compensation. The Wyzen Initiative believes in “Data Dividend” — individuals should be paid for their digital footprint if monetized.
