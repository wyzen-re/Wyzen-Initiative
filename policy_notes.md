# Policy Notes

A running log of ideas, inspirations, and things to test for PrivNet.

## Notes

- GDPR is good but slow and confusing; we need *real-time enforcement*.  
- Data is being exploited — consider a *“Data Dividend”* where users are compensated if their data is monetized.  
- P2P networks with optional relays could make privacy *fast and reliable*.  
- Encrypted vaults let users keep control even if servers fail.

## Ideas to Explore

- Make it easy for *low-end devices* to participate.  
- Automatic key exchange to simplify connections.  
- Incentives for relay servers without compromising privacy.  
- Visual guides for new users to understand how their data is protected.
